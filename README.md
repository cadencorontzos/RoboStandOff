# RoboStandOff
A simple game for iOS using Swift and Spritekit

This game was created using Xcode, compatible with iOS 14. It is a basic shooter game, in which you are a space explorer and robots are attempting
to destory your damaged ship. With no where to turn, you are forced to protect your ship against the oncoming hordes.

Note that I have no formal training in Swift. All of the assets (robots, ship, shooter, etc) were custom made with the online editor pixilart.com

Bugs to Be Fixed:

  Formatting - The formatting is off for iPad. The top bar is not visible.
  
  
  
 Other possible additions:
 
 Speed - Ideally, the robots should get faster as score increases, and time between spawns get shorter.
 
 Full Menu - Right now the "menu" is just a series of SpriteNodes. It would be nice to have an actual menu to navigate.
